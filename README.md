## Introduction

A play-cljs game in which ... well, that part is up to you.
Do `boot run` to develop and `boot build` to compile a release version.

* whenever any boot task is run(e.g. `boot run`) `project.clj` is generated automatically
  so that IntelliJ will understand this as a leiningen project and Cursive can help our development.
* go to (localhost:3000) to see running project
* go to (localhost:4000) to edit project on browser (although cursive is much more powerful)
* run `boot check` to find out if your code can be improved
